# Database Indexing
- A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional space and write overhead.
- Without indexing db query performs full table scan ( means scans through every row ), which is time consuming. With indexing, database lookup is much faster using the index ( avoids scanning the entire table ).
