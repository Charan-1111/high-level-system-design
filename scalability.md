# Scalability

- As the system grows, the performance of the system starts to degrade unless we adapt it to deal with that growth.
- Scalability is the property of a system to handler a growing amount of load by adding resources to the system without sacrificing performance or reliability.
- A system that can continuously evolve to support a growing amount of work is scalable.


- ### How can a system grows
    - A system can grow in serveral dimensions.
        - More users
        - More features
        - More data
        - More complexity
        - More geographics

    1. ### Growth in user base
        - More users starts using the system, leading to increased number of requests.
            - <u>Eg</u>. A social media platform experiencing a surge in new users.

    
    2. ### Growth in features
        - More features were introduced to expand system capabilities.
            - <u>Eg</u>. An e-commerce application adding support for a new payment mehtod.

    3. ### Growth in data volume
        - Growth in the amount of data the system stores and manages due to user activity or logging.
            - <u>Eg</u>. A video streaming platform like youtube storing a lot of information

    4. ### Growth in comlexity
        - The system's architecture evolves to accommodate new features, scale, or integrations, resulting in additional components and dependencies.
            - <u>Eg</u>. A system that started as a simple application is broken into smaller, independent systems.

    5. ### Growth in geographic reach
        - The system is expanded to server users in new regions or contries
            - <u>Eg</u>. An e-commerce company launching websites and distribution in new regions.
