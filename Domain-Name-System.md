# Domain Name System ( DNS )
- Domain Name System ( DNS ) is a distributed hierarchial naming system that translates human readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses.
- Computers communicates using IP addresses, but humans remember names easily.

- ## Components of DNS
	- **DNS Resolver ( Client )** - First contact point.
	- **Root DNS Server** - The top of the hierarchy, it knows where to find the authoritative servers for top-level domains.
	- **TLD DNS Server** - Responsible for a specific top-level domain. It tells where to find the authoritative name servers for that domain.
	- **Authoritative DNS Server** - Holds the actual DNS records for the domain. It is the final source of truth.

- ## Step-by-Step DNS Resolution Process
	- Step 1 :- **Query Initiation**
		- We enter www.example.com in the browser.
		- Browser checks its cache to see if it already knows the IP address.
	- Step 2 :- **OS/Local Cache**
		- If the browser doesn't know, it asks the operating system.
		- OS checks its local DNS cache
	- Step 3 :- **Recursive Resolver**
		- If not found locally, the OS sends a query to the DNS Resolver.
		- The resolver now takes the responsibility for finding the IP address.
	- Step 4 :- **Root Server Query**
		- The resolver asks a Root DNS server : "where can i find .com domains ?".
		- The root server replies with a TLD Server address from .com.
	- Step 5 :- **TLD Server Query**
		- The resolver asks the .com TLD server : "where can i find example.com ?".
		- TLD server responds with Authoritative Name Server for example.com.
	- Step 6 :- **Authoritative Server Query**
		- The resolver now queries the Authoritative DNS Server : "where is the IP address for www.example.com ? ".
		- Authoritative server replies with A record.
	- Step 7 :- **Response and Caching**
		- The resolver passes the IP address back to the browser.
		- The result is cached by
			- The rsolver.
			- The OS.
			- The browser.
		- Future requests for the same domain will be faster.
	- Step 8 :- The browser now makes a TCP or a HTTPS connection with the IP address.
